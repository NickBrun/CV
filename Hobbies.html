            <li>I love to draw and paint and i also love <strong><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nbartjourney">digital
                        art.</a></strong> For me art has been a huge part of my life and ive always been a huge fan of it
                some of my favorite artists are Boris Vellajo and Julie Bell, Robert Bateman and many more.
                Art has this amazing way of not only catching the imagination but also telling stories which is something
                I love.

        <ul>
            <li>
                I love not only playing but building video games and in the near future will be pursuing that as a full time
                career path but until then i am just hanging out and having fun.
